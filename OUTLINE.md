# ADVENTURE GAME OUTLINE

## Basic Idea

The basic idea is to create an adventure game to accompany Shane's online tutoring application. The game will include adventure and exploration qualities integrated with the problem solving skills taught in the tutoring app. This will give students the ability to practice the skills they have learned in a different (hopefully, more exciting) environment. 

## Main Game 'Chunks'

The individual pieces of the game experience.

### World Map

An overall view of a 'themed' world based on each specific concept. An example: The 'Algebra' world map might include places like 'Polynomial Pass', 'Factoring Falls' and 'The Strait of Substitution'. The idea would be multiple paths of completion for any specific map. Also, each map would be unique (i.e. not only would the names be changed for another concept, but the paths themselves would be different).

### Encounter Modules 

These would open up in a 'Super Mario World' type fasion. Each stopping point within a world map would spawn a (possibly random) encounter module. Below are some possibilities for encounter modules:

#### Time Based 

- Module challenges for a certain number of problems to be completed in a certain amount of time. 
- Incorrect problems take time away.

-- Front End

- Some indication that you are in a timed 'pickel'. 
- A timer must be visible
- An area for problem presentation
- An area for solution input
- Easy recognition of CORRECT or INCORRECT (possibly with GREEN/RED)
- Some indication of how close you are to completing the required number of problems to get out of the 'pickel'

-- Back End

- API to deliver problem 


#### Puzzle Based

- Similar to a cryptex, the player must solve N number of problems in a row. We will show rotating cylinders as part of the cryptex. A wrong answer will reshuffle the cryptex back to the beginning. 

#### Labyrinth Based

- Basically a maze. Every move requires 1 problem solution. An incorrect problem solution encounters a monster mini battle. The battle is acted out with some (simpler concept) mini practice app. Each correct mini problem answer is a 'Boom', 'Bang', 'Wham' type  answer. Upon defeating the monster, you may move on. If the monster defeats YOU, you go back to the beginning of the maze.
